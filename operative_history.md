  Abstract
  ========

  Manfredo Tafuri's caveats regarding 'operative criticism' as a
  progressive solution to the lack of political efficacy and of
  scholarly rigour in the militant architectural history of the
  mid-twentieth century had, in his time, little following.
  Architectural historians sought greater professional specialisation
  not 'operativeness,' whereas architectural theorists, by the late
  1970s, were beginning to embrace the 'linguistic turn' and its
  nihilistic view of historical knowledge.

  In the ever-widening split that has characterised the global
  scholarship of architecture ever since, Italy nonetheless gave rise to
  a network of typo-morphological studies founded upon both rigorous
  historiography and a coherent theory underpinning the operative use of
  this historical knowledge in architectural design. This 'school'---for
  want of a better word---is perhaps unique, this paper argues, in that
  it defines a clear scope of objects and methods pertaining to the
  disciplinary field of architecture as a whole, thus providing a
  unified framework for both historiography and design.

  Yet, the Italian 'school' of typo-morphological history and theory is
  diverse, exposing rifts between traditionalists and modernists. The
  former are tributary of Aldo Rossi's postmodernist formal
  relationships derived from a concept of 'collective memory,' whereas
  the latter adopt Saverio Muratori's 'procedural typology' as a tool
  for generating abstract spatial relationships. Historians,
  theoreticians, and designers are now moving on from the long-standing
  primacy of Medieval and Renaissance studies, and of the post-war
  reconstructions of Venice and Rome. This paper focuses on recent
  studies in nineteenth century architecture as well as new projects in
  the Po river plains cities---Alessandria, Parma, Bologna---that
  clarify these theoretical conflicts yet show the way forward for
  'operative' historiography and typological theory in the Italian
  school.

Introduction
============

The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy
resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary
writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori (1910--1973),
Aldo Rossi (1931--1997), and Mafredo Tafuri (1935--1994). Their often
conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its
relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary
parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments
for much of the international debate around these themes. The validity
of extracting 'operative' knowledge from history for use in
architectural and urban practice is one of the most controversial
debates in which they engaged. This debate is expressed most clearly in
their differing attitudes towards typology as either an art historical
device or a theory of the architectural planning process.

The Italian universe of typological studies is probably best known
through Aldo Rossi's idiosyncratic definition of the concept, in *The
Architecture of the City,* as the study of 'constants' underlying urban
and architectural 'facts' and discernible in them
[@rossi:2006architettura, 33]. Muratori's contribution, on the other
hand, is restricted to the technical domain of urban morphology
[@cataldi:2013debito, 14], to a great extent due to his ostracism from
the mainstream critical panorama, brought about by his ideological
condemnation at the hands of Bruno Zevi and Tafuri
[@pigafetta:1990saverio, 29]. Tafuri himself towers tall as one of the
most acclaimed architectural historians of the post--1968 era, not the
least for his combative---though at times inconsistent---argument for
the critical autonomy of architectural history outside the professional
scope of the architectural discipline [@tafuri:1988teorie, 268].

Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical
perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one
another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and
practice, the scopes of which have been increasingly delimited to
reflect their respective methodological and ideological *partis pris*
This segmentation of theories and scholarship influenced by Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent
engagement with one another's theories [As evidenced by
@moschini:2013saverio; @petruccioli:1998exoteric; @lobsinger:2006new59;
@murro:2019storia]; it also obscures the claim put forward by each one
of them to a systematic representation of and agency on the urban
environment.


Architecture as process, history as fragments
=============================================

Concepts and methods
--------------------

- 2 kinds of historicism: Avant-garde teleology of history and Crocean
  'philosophy as history';
- Drops stylistic analysis in favour of 'elective affinities' of
  artists and works with their contemporary context;
- 'Metodologia dell'elenco' in both historiography and design;
- Primacy of historical knowledge over normative theory, the latter
  always derived from the former, when it is admitted.


Domain of architecture
----------------------

- Building a structure and building the city as recursive processes;
- Abandon view of city and territory as artefacts in favour of
  processes;
- Extant city as main object, infill as main operation.


Historicist criticism and operative synthesis
=============================================

Tools of architectural historiography
-------------------------------------

- History vs. memory


Memory and the critical consciousness
-------------------------------------

- On the ability of criticism to leverage the embodied knowledge of
  spontaneous consciousness.


Typology, abstraction, and figuration
=====================================

Typology and its conflicts
--------------------------

- Does 'type' exist?
- Scales of typology: space, structure, ornament;
- Typological process is a form of historicism.


Traditionalism in Process
-------------------------

- From 'morality' to tangible objects;


Operativeness in historical perspective
=======================================

- Intrahistory and casticism;
- Present reality is at the same time singular (yet apt to be
  contaminated by the artefacts of memory) and a collapsed state of
  all previous history.

- The present as a *result* of the past is an illusion crafted by
  collective memory, because 'the present' is itself an identity
  crafted in the present;
- The present as *different* from the past is an illusion crafted by
  (teleological) historicism, because 'the past' ultimately does not
  exist;
- Both are therefore inadequate justifications for practice because
  they focus on the *movement* from past to present, which is not
  experienced but is a mental construct.

- The present, collapsed state of the city is all we have;
- The role of history is to *pull apart* this collapsed state and
  to make *discrete* images of its moments in time;
- The role of design is to *synthesise* this collapsed state and
  to make *the whole* coherent and imageable at a single point of
  intervention.
