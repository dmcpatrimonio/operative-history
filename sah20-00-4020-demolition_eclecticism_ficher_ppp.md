The story of how
eclecticism was passionately denounced and,
somewhat less enthusiastically, promoted or recovered
has been told masterfully by Summerson, Watkin,
Egbert, among others, with respect to then-major centers
of architectural theorization.
The fate of eclecticism in the global periphery,
on the other hand, has long been dismissed as
a delayed offshoot of European trends,
with little consideration given to
local theoretical formulations.

Brazil is such a case in which the moral
demolition of eclecticism display peculiar aspects
which differ significantly from Anglo-French theories.
The critical fortune of Brazilian eclectic architecture
is intertwined with nationalist politics
in a way that would look unfamiliar from
the perspective of ethnic historicism
and nationalist *rappel Ã  l'ordre*, more common in Europe.
Brazilian writers generally defined eclecticism
as foreign influence---interpreted either as
an unforgivable weakness of national character,
or as a creative yet systematic marker of
much-needed cosmopolitanism.
To compound this complex and contradictory debate,
modernist intellectuals and practitioners
succeeded in branding Corbusian architecture
as eminently "national" and suppressing eclecticism---both
theoretically and in demolishing actual buildings---as
a promiscuous and unauthentic "mistake."

In this paper, we deconstruct the hegemonic discourse
of eclecticism as the superficial repetition of precedents,
retracing the roots of this assertion to
the shifting discourses of practitioners and critics
throughout the twentieth century.
Furthermore, we reclaim the creative and cosmopolitan
nature of eclecticism, as opposed to the conventional
view of historicist architecture as nostalgic nationalism.
For this, we rely on a parallel between old-world theorists
and Brazilian critics, practitioners, and historians.
These range from Beaux-Arts teachers
who embraced eclectic cosmopolitanism,
to modernists whose nationalist discourse was instrumental
in discrediting historicist architecture.
This parallel builds up a picture of eclecticism as
a coherent and original approach defeated by
the onslaught not only of modernism, but also of nationalism.
