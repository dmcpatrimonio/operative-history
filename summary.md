abstract: |
  The Italian debates of the post-war era regarding the possibility of
  an 'operative' history of architecture, revolving around Manfredo
  Tafuri's critique of Saverio Muratori's method of procedural typology
  and his ambiguous stance on Aldo Rossi's later work, provide the
  theoretical background for a present-day 'Italian school' of
  typo-morphology. This 'school' is split between the modernist
  disciples of Muratori and the younger traditionalists, loosely
  inspired by Rossi. The points of agreement and of disagreement within
  this school point to a continued reevaluation of Tafuri's call for a
  critical and autonomous historiography, although the theoretical
  pitfalls of giving an operative role to historical knowledge are ever
  present.

description: |
  Manfredo Tafuri's caveats regarding 'operative criticism' as a
  progressive solution to the lack of political efficacy and of
  scholarly rigour in the militant architectural history of the
  mid-twentieth century had, in his time, little following.
  Architectural historians sought greater professional specialisation
  not 'operativeness,' whereas architectural theorists, by the late
  1970s, were beginning to embrace the 'linguistic turn' and its
  nihilistic view of historical knowledge.

  In the ever-widening split that has characterised the global
  scholarship of architecture ever since, Italy nonetheless gave rise to
  a network of typo-morphological studies founded upon both rigorous
  historiography and a coherent theory underpinning the operative use of
  this historical knowledge in architectural design. This 'school'---for
  want of a better word---is perhaps unique, this paper argues, in that
  it defines a clear scope of objects and methods pertaining to the
  disciplinary field of architecture as a whole, thus providing a
  unified framework for both historiography and design.

  Yet, the Italian 'school' of typo-morphological history and theory is
  diverse, exposing rifts between traditionalists and modernists. The
  former are tributary of Aldo Rossi's postmodernist formal
  relationships derived from a concept of 'collective memory,' whereas
  the latter adopt Saverio Muratori's 'procedural typology' as a tool
  for generating abstract spatial relationships. Historians,
  theoreticians, and designers are now moving on from the long-standing
  primacy of Medieval and Renaissance studies, and of the post-war
  reconstructions of Venice and Rome. This paper focuses on recent
  studies in nineteenth century architecture as well as new projects in
  the Po river plains cities---Alessandria, Parma, Bologna---that
  clarify these theoretical conflicts yet show the way forward for
  'operative' historiography and typological theory in the Italian
  school.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy
resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary
writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori,
Aldo Rossi, and Manfredo Tafuri. Their often
conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its
relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary
parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments
for much of the international debate around these themes.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
The validity of extracting 'operative' knowledge from history for use in
architectural and urban practice is one among many debates in which
these architects engaged. This controversy is
expressed most clearly in their differing attitudes towards typology as
either an art historical device or a theory of the architectural
planning process.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical
perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one
another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and
practice, the scopes of which have been increasingly delimited to
reflect their respective methodological and ideological *partis pris.*
This segmentation of theories and scholarship influenced by Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent
engagement with one another's theories; it also obscures the claim put
forward by each one of them to a systematic representation of and agency
on the urban environment.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
These claims unfolded throughout their careers and legacies on four
successive levels I shall develop in this paper. At first, Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri all grappled with the fragmented nature of historical
evidence and the conflicting ways by which they sought to explain
architecture as a process. Their various responses to this problem led
to the second level, in which Tafuri's strictly critical stance breaks
away from the operative methods laid out by Muratori and Rossi. In the
third level, Muratori's legacy of an all-encompassing theory of urban
succession, carried on by his disciples, came to be at odds with the
later work of Rossi, increasingly interested in local and visual
references over abstract theories. Finally, in the fourth level I will
look at a few living architects who have carried on the operative
typologies of both Muratori and Rossi.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Let us start out with the scope of
objects and methods pertaining to the architectural discipline, reaching
back to the superimposition of Idealist philosophy and socialist
politics that was pervasive in post-war Italian architectural circles.
This disciplinary framing understood
architecture to be not a specific set of objects, real or potential, but
a process of bringing about change in the urban fabric. Conversely,
history was not envisaged as a coherent narrative to be 'found', but as
a collection of fragments to make sense of in a piecemeal fashion.

# Critique and Operativity #

## {.unlisted}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Muratori's 'operative history' and Tafuri's 'critical history' both
looked at the problem of the historical fragment as the starting point
for a discussion of the built environment in a process of becoming, but
they looked at it from opposite ends. Muratori took the fragments that
made up the built environment as instances of *a priori* types, then
sought to explain the overall coherence of the historic city as an
outcome of the typological process. To Tafuri, on the other hand, it is
the nature of the historical process that was given *a priori*: the
deterministic advance of capitalist technocracy since the early
Renaissance. The historian's task was then to fit, provisionally, the
fragments of architecture's increasingly dead body onto an ever-changing
picture of this advance.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Muratori's application of 'operative history' was perceived as
reactionary in his own time, especially in light of his winning
competition entry for the Barene di San Giuliano urban project in 1959.
Against this, Tafuri used a Marxist lens predicating a clear-cut
separation between the production of the built environment and its
historiographic critique. Ostensibly, this was a plea for an
architectural history endowed with 'positive skills' to counteract vapid
theorizing. In practice, it stemmed from his Marxist belief that the
*practice* of architecture was, by the late twentieth century, well on
its way to dissolving in the undifferentiated scope of 'planning'.
Architecture, in Tafuri's view, became the stuff of history much in the
same way Hegel had proclaimed Art belonged to the past.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
The difference between Muratori's and Tafuri's treatment of the
historical process stemmed from their different philosophies of reality.
In the Idealist theory developed by Muratori, the historic territory and
its reconstructed past had real, if not immediately tangible, existence.
Tafuri's dialectic, on the other hand, handled the 'perpetual critique'
of historical fragments as a way of exorcizing, so to speak, the very
existence of a tangible reality. Tafuri's ideal contemporary architect
was, therefore, perennially locked into this state of crisis: either a
planner not designer, who would 'accept the transitional (and therefore
ambiguous) role played nowadays by a dismembered and multifarious
discipline', or a destroyer of conventional meaning such as the younger
Aldo Rossi, who took the existing city 'as a mere pretext' and let
architecture 'hang dangerously in the balance: its reality, never denied
outright, but mischievously mingled with the unreal'.

# Figuration: the New Classicists #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
The cracks developing from these conflicts become rifts, on a third
level, between the 'modernist' disciples of Muratori---among them
Gianfranco Caniggia, Gian Luigi Maffei, Giancarlo Cataldi, and Giuseppe
Strappa---and the 'traditionalists' or 'new classicists'---such as Pier
Carlo Bontempi, Gabriele
Tagliaventi, and Cristiano Rosponi---loosely inspired by the figurative
character of Rossi's later work. This cleaving of the 'Italian school'
hinges on the decomposition of the urban 'organism', in the work of
living practitioners, according to diverging hierarchies of abstract and
figurative elements. This conflict exposes conceptual weaknesses in
the theories supporting typological design, in terms of the choices
practitioners make when appropriating and making sense of urban
fragments.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
Thus, the analysis turns back for a final look at how critical
historiography addresses the shortcomings of operativity. By looking at
the interaction of historical scholarship and design practice in the
work of architects who combine both activities, the theoretical
assumptions linking both fields become clear. The typological
contradictions between the 'historic city' strictly
defined---preindustrial urbanism---and the
urban fabric of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
appears as an unresolved conflict  in the methods and judgements of
'modernists' from the Muratorian school and of
traditionalists alike.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: notes
All three stances, Tafuri's historical critique, Muratori's operative
history, and Rossi's free-form typology, made relevant points about the
nature of reality in architecture and its history. In a sense, Tafuri's
implicit foundational belief that the past does not *exist* in reality
is true: all we have at hand is the whole of surviving fragments of
history collapsed onto the present; ascribing some of these fragments to
'the present' or 'the past' is an operation of memory and critique,
however ingrained certain attributions must be for any sort of discourse
to be effective. On the other hand, this collapsed state of all of
history onto the present is precisely what grants legitimacy to
Muratori's normative claim that the existing city be the starting point
of new construction. The role of history is indeed to pull apart this
collapsed state into discrete images of aspects or moments in a virtual
reconstruction of time; conversely, the role of design is to synthesize
this collapsed state by making a fractured accumulation of instances
whole and imageable at a single point of intervention.
