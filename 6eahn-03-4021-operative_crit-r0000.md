Manfredo Tafuri's call for 'operative criticism' as
a progressive solution to the lack of political efficacy and
of scholarly rigour in the militant architectural history of
the mid-twentieth century had, in his time, little
following.
Architectural historians sought greater professional
specialisation not 'operativeness,' whereas architectural
theorists, by the late 1970s, were beginning to embrace the
'linguistic turn' and its nihilistic view of historical
knowledge.

In the ever-widening split that has characterised the global
scholarship of architecture ever since, Italy nonetheless
gave rise to a network of typo-morphological studies founded
upon both rigorous historiography and a coherent theory
underpinning the operative use of this historical knowledge
in architectural design.
This 'school'---for want of a better word---is perhaps
unique, this paper argues, in that it defines a clear scope
of objects and methods pertaining to the disciplinary field
of architecture as a whole, thus providing a unified
framework for both historiography and design.

Yet, the Italian 'school' of typo-morphological history and
theory is diverse, exposing rifts between traditionalists
and modernists.
The former are tributary of Aldo Rossi's postmodernist
formal relationships derived from a concept of 'collective
memory,' whereas the latter adopt Saverio Muratori's
'procedural typology' as a tool for generating abstract
spatial relationships.
Historians, theoreticians, and designers are now moving on
from the long-standing primacy of Medieval and Renaissance
studies, and of the post-war reconstructions of Venice and
Rome.
This paper will focus on recent studies in nineteenth
century architecture as well as new projects in the Po river
plains cities---Alessandria, Parma, Bologna---that clarify
these theoretical conflicts yet show the way forward for
'operative' historiography and typological theory in the
Italian school.
