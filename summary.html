<p>The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori, Aldo Rossi, and Manfredo Tafuri. Their often conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments for much of the international debate around these themes.</p>
<p>The validity of extracting ‘operative’ knowledge from history for use in architectural and urban practice is one among many debates in which these architects engaged. This controversy is expressed most clearly in their differing attitudes towards typology as either an art historical device or a theory of the architectural planning process.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and practice, the scopes of which have been increasingly delimited to reflect their respective methodological and ideological <em>partis pris.</em> This segmentation of theories and scholarship influenced by Muratori, Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent engagement with one another’s theories; it also obscures the claim put forward by each one of them to a systematic representation of and agency on the urban environment.</p>
<p>These claims unfolded throughout their careers and legacies on four successive levels I shall develop in this paper. At first, Muratori, Rossi, and Tafuri all grappled with the fragmented nature of historical evidence and the conflicting ways by which they sought to explain architecture as a process. Their various responses to this problem led to the second level, in which Tafuri’s strictly critical stance breaks away from the operative methods laid out by Muratori and Rossi. In the third level, Muratori’s legacy of an all-encompassing theory of urban succession, carried on by his disciples, came to be at odds with the later work of Rossi, increasingly interested in local and visual references over abstract theories. Finally, in the fourth level I will look at a few living architects who have carried on the operative typologies of both Muratori and Rossi.</p>

<p>Let us start out with the scope of objects and methods pertaining to the architectural discipline, reaching back to the superimposition of Idealist philosophy and socialist politics that was pervasive in post-war Italian architectural circles. This disciplinary framing understood architecture to be not a specific set of objects, real or potential, but a process of bringing about change in the urban fabric. Conversely, history was not envisaged as a coherent narrative to be ‘found,’ but as a collection of fragments to make sense of in a piecemeal fashion.</p>

<h2>Critique and Operativity</h2>

<div class="notes">
<p>Muratori’s ‘operative history’ and Tafuri’s ‘critical history’ both looked at the problem of the historical fragment as the starting point for a discussion of the built environment in a process of becoming, but they looked at it from opposite ends. Muratori took the fragments that made up the built environment as instances of <em>a priori</em> types, then sought to explain the overall coherence of the historic city as an outcome of the typological process. To Tafuri, on the other hand, it is the nature of the historical process that was given <em>a priori</em>: the deterministic advance of capitalist technocracy since the early Renaissance. The historian’s task was then to fit, provisionally, the fragments of architecture’s increasingly dead body onto an ever-changing picture of this advance.</p>

<div class="notes">
<p>Muratori’s application of ‘operative history’ was perceived as reactionary in his own time, especially in light of his winning competition entry for the Barene di San Giuliano urban project in 1959. Against this, Tafuri used a Marxist lens predicating a clear-cut separation between the production of the built environment and its historiographic critique. Ostensibly, this was a plea for an architectural history endowed with ‘positive skills’ to counteract vapid theorizing. In practice, it stemmed from his Marxist belief that the <em>practice</em> of architecture was, by the late twentieth century, well on its way to dissolving in the undifferentiated scope of ‘planning.’ Architecture, in Tafuri’s view, became the stuff of history much in the same way Hegel had proclaimed Art belonged to the past.</p>

<p>The difference between Muratori’s and Tafuri’s treatment of the historical process stemmed from their different philosophies of reality. In the Idealist theory developed by Muratori, the historic territory and its reconstructed past had real, if not immediately tangible, existence. Tafuri’s dialectic, on the other hand, handled the ‘perpetual critique’ of historical fragments as a way of exorcizing, so to speak, the very existence of a tangible reality. Tafuri’s ideal contemporary architect was, therefore, perennially locked into this state of crisis: either a planner not designer, who would ‘accept the transitional (and therefore ambiguous) role played nowadays by a dismembered and multifarious discipline,’ or a destroyer of conventional meaning such as the younger Aldo Rossi, who took the existing city ‘as a mere pretext’ and let architecture ‘hang dangerously in the balance: its reality, never denied outright, but mischievously mingled with the unreal.’</p>

<h2>Figuration: the New Classicists</h2>
<div class="notes">
<p>The cracks developing from these conflicts become rifts, on a third level, between the ‘modernist’ disciples of Muratori—among them Gianfranco Caniggia, Gian Luigi Maffei, Giancarlo Cataldi, and Giuseppe Strappa—and the ‘traditionalists’ or ‘new classicists’—such as Pier Carlo Bontempi, Gabriele Tagliaventi, and Cristiano Rosponi—loosely inspired by the figurative character of Rossi’s later work. This cleaving of the ‘Italian school’ hinges on the decomposition of the urban ‘organism,’ in the work of living practitioners, according to diverging hierarchies of abstract and figurative elements. This conflict exposes conceptual weaknesses in the theories supporting typological design, in terms of the choices practitioners make when appropriating and making sense of urban fragments.</p>

<p>Thus, the analysis turns back for a final look at how critical historiography addresses the shortcomings of operativity. By looking at the interaction of historical scholarship and design practice in the work of architects who combine both activities, the theoretical assumptions linking both fields become clear. The typological contradictions between the ‘historic city’ strictly defined—preindustrial urbanism—and the urban fabric of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appears as an unresolved conflict in the methods and judgements of ‘modernists’ from the Muratorian school and of traditionalists alike.</p>

<p>All three stances, Tafuri’s historical critique, Muratori’s operative history, and Rossi’s free-form typology, made relevant points about the nature of reality in architecture and its history. In a sense, Tafuri’s implicit foundational belief that the past does not <em>exist</em> in reality is true: all we have at hand is the whole of surviving fragments of history collapsed onto the present; ascribing some of these fragments to ‘the present’ or ‘the past’ is an operation of memory and critique, however ingrained certain attributions must be for any sort of discourse to be effective. On the other hand, this collapsed state of all of history onto the present is precisely what grants legitimacy to Muratori’s normative claim that the existing city be the starting point of new construction. The role of history is indeed to pull apart this collapsed state into discrete images of aspects or moments in a virtual reconstruction of time; conversely, the role of design is to synthesize this collapsed state by making a fractured accumulation of instances whole and imageable at a single point of intervention.</p>
