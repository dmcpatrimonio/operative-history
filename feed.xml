This 'school' is split between the modernist disciples of Muratori and the younger traditionalists, loosely inspired by Rossi. The points of agreement and of disagreement within this school point to a continued reevaluation of Tafuri's call for a critical and autonomous historiography, although the theoretical pitfalls of giving an operative role to historical knowledge are ever present.</subtitle></feed>
