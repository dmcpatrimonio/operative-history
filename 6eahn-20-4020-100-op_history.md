Introduction
============


Disciplinary framing of architecture in post-war Italy
======================================================

Concepts and methods
--------------------

- 2 kinds of historicism: Avant-garde teleology of history and Crocean
  'philosophy as history';
- Drops stylistic analysis in favour of 'elective affinities' of
  artists and works with their contemporary context;
- 'Metodologia dell'elenco' in both historiography and design;
- Primacy of historical knowledge over normative theory, the latter
  always derived from the former, when it is admitted.


Domain of architecture
----------------------

- Building a structure and building the city as recursive processes;
- Abandon view of city and territory as artefacts in favour of
  processes;
- Extant city as main object, infill as main operation.


Historicist criticism and operative synthesis
=============================================

Tools of architectural historiography
-------------------------------------

- History vs. memory


Memory and the critical consciousness
-------------------------------------

- On the ability of criticism to leverage the embodied knowledge of
  spontaneous consciousness.


Typology, abstraction, and figuration
=====================================

Typology and its conflicts
--------------------------

- Does 'type' exist?
- Scales of typology: space, structure, ornament;
- Typological process is a form of historicism.


Traditionalism in Process
-------------------------

- From 'morality' to tangible objects;


Operativeness in historical perspective
=======================================

- Intrahistory and casticism;
- Present reality is at the same time singular (yet apt to be
  contaminated by the artefacts of memory) and a collapsed state of
  all previous history.

- The present as a *result* of the past is an illusion crafted by
  collective memory, because 'the present' is itself an identity
  crafted in the present;
- The present as *different* from the past is an illusion crafted by
  (teleological) historicism, because 'the past' ultimately does not
  exist;
- Both are therefore inadequate justifications for practice because
  they focus on the *movement* from past to present, which is not
  experienced but is a mental construct.

- The present, collapsed state of the city is all we have;
- The role of history is to *pull apart* this collapsed state and
  to make *discrete* images of its moments in time;
- The role of design is to *synthesise* this collapsed state and
  to make *the whole* coherent and imageable at a single point of
  intervention.
