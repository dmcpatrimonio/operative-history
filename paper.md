  ## Abstract ##

  The Italian debates of the post-war era regarding the possibility of
  an 'operative' history of architecture revolved around Manfredo
  Tafuri's critique of Saverio Muratori's method of procedural typology
  and his ambiguous stance on Aldo Rossi's later work. They provide the
  theoretical background for a present-day 'Italian school' of
  typo-morphology. This 'school' is split between the modernist
  disciples of Muratori and the younger traditionalists, loosely
  inspired by Rossi. The points of agreement and of disagreement within
  this school point to a continued reevaluation of Tafuri's call for a
  critical and autonomous historiography, although the theoretical
  pitfalls of giving an operative role to historical knowledge are ever
  present.

# Introduction #

The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy
resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary
writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori (1910--73),
Aldo Rossi (1931--97), and Manfredo Tafuri (1935--94). Their often
conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its
relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary
parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments
for much of the international debate around these themes.
The validity of extracting 'operative' knowledge from history for use in
architectural and urban practice is one among many debates in which
these architects engaged [@purini:2013saverio, 62]. This controversy is
expressed most clearly in their differing attitudes towards typology as
either an art historical device or a theory of the architectural
planning process.

The Italian universe of typological studies is probably best known
from Aldo Rossi's idiosyncratic definition of the concept, in *The
Architecture of the City,* as the study of 'constants' underlying urban
and architectural 'facts' and discernible in them
[@rossi:2006architettura, 33]. Saverio Muratori's contribution, on the
other hand, is restricted to the technical domain of urban morphology
[@cataldi:2013debito, 14], to a great extent due to his ostracism from
the mainstream critical panorama, brought about by his ideological
condemnation at the hands of Bruno Zevi and Manfredo Tafuri
[@pigafetta:1990saverio, 29]. Tafuri himself towers tall as one of the
most acclaimed architectural historians of the post--1968 era, not the
least for his combative---though at times inconsistent---argument for
the critical autonomy of architectural history outside the professional
scope of the architectural discipline [@tafuri:1988teorie, 268].

Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical
perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one
another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and
practice, the scopes of which have been increasingly delimited to
reflect their respective methodological and ideological *partis pris.*
This segmentation of theories and scholarship influenced by Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent
engagement with one another's theories [As evidenced by
@moschini:2013saverio; @petruccioli:1998exoteric; @lobsinger:2006new59;
@murro:2019storia]; it also obscures the claim put forward by each one
of them to a systematic representation of and agency on the urban
environment.

The confrontation of Tafuri's critical underpinnings for an autonomous
and critical history of architecture [@biraghi:2005progetto] with
Muratori's and Rossi's methods for the operative leveraging of
historical research in design exposes the overarching conflicts in world
view among them, of course, but beneath these differences certain
fundamental affinities show through, evidencing how they partake in the
major intellectual and political themes of their age. These affinities
have not, however, been carried on by their disciples and interpreters
as clearly as their differences. This has caused Muratori's, Rossi's,
and Tafuri's work to become somewhat abstract and disconnected from the
role they all expected their critique to play in the transformation of
urban planning [@tafuri:1980sfera, 24]. In other words, what they have
in common is they intended not so much to propose a general theory of
architectural form---for Muratori was sceptical of formal rules, Rossi
was sceptical of generalizations, and Tafuri was sceptical of
theorizing---, but rather to look at the contemporary city as a
*process* to be acted upon politically and technically
[@muratori:1959studiIX, 132].

In light of their common goal of contributing critically to processes
rather than objects, one can begin to draw a clearer picture of their
affinities and conflicts, putting the acrid debates of the 1960s and 70s
in the long-term perspective of how their legacies have been, and could
be, carried on throughout the evolving ideological configurations of the
architectural profession. To this end, the study of the direct 'lineage'
of the second and third generation of Muratori's disciples
[@cataldi:2002saverio6], as well as of other practitioners and scholars
influenced by Rossi's poetics of the city and by Tafuri's critical
historiography, offers an overview of what rigorous architectural
scholarship can look like in the present day. This loosely defined group
of architects may be, for starters, grouped in an 'Italian school of
typology'.

This 'school' shall be defined, initially, by the shared scope of
objects and methods pertaining to the architectural discipline, reaching
back to the superimposition of idealist philosophy and socialist
politics that was pervasive in post-war Italian architectural circles
[@leach:2007manfredo, 47]. This disciplinary framing understands
architecture to be not a specific set of objects, real or potential, but
a process of bringing about change in the urban fabric; conversely,
history is not envisaged as a coherent narrative to be 'found', but as a
collection of fragments of which to make sense in a piecemeal fashion
[@zevi:1974architettura, 55].
On top of this common ground, providing a shared understanding of the
profession's role in the contemporary world, a second level of analysis
reveals an implicit awareness of the conflicts between historiographic
critique, ever bent on scattering and reassembling the fragments in
infinite ways [@tafuri:1977storico, 17], and operative synthesis,
demanding agreement, if limited and provisional, on reconstructed
'memories' of the urban process to be acted upon critically
[@stoppani:2010lhistoire, 220].

The cracks developing from these conflicts become rifts, on a third
level, between the 'modernist' disciples of Muratori
[@caniggia:1984introduzione, 12]---among them Gianfranco Caniggia, Gian
Luigi Maffei, Giancarlo Cataldi, and Giuseppe Strappa---and the
'traditionalists' [@rosponi:2004new] or 'new classicists'
[@papadakis:1990new]---such as Pier Carlo Bontempi, Gabriele
Tagliaventi, and Cristiano Rosponi---loosely inspired by the figurative
character of Rossi's later work. This cleaving of the 'Italian school'
hinges on the decomposition of the urban 'organism', in the work of
living practitioners, according to diverging hierarchies of abstract and
figurative elements [An example of conflicting hierarchies is patent in
the ancillary role ascribed to construction and detailing in
@caniggia:1987progetto]. This conflict exposes conceptual weaknesses in
the theories supporting typological design, in terms of the choices
practitioners make when appropriating and making sense of urban
fragments.

Thus, the analysis turns back for a final look at how critical
historiography addresses the shortcomings of operativity. By looking at
the interaction of historical scholarship and design practice in the
work of architects who combine both activities [See, for example,
@tagliaventi:2007manuale; @tagliaventi:2000tecniche], the theoretical
assumptions linking both fields become clear. The typological
contradictions between the 'historic city' strictly
defined---preindustrial urbanism [@caniggia:2008lettura, 23]---and the
urban fabric of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
appears as an unresolved conflict  in the methods and judgements of
'modernists' from the Muratorian school [@strappa:1989tradizione] and of
traditionalists alike [@tagliaventi:2006european18].

# Architecture as process, history as fragments #

Where Tafuri, Muratori, and Rossi all stand together (against Zevi).

First, we discuss the difference between the practice of architecture
and architectural history, according to Tafuri. For this, we have to
agree that the built environment is an object (artifact = historical
source) that provides evidence of a process (urban facts = reconstructed
historical narrative). History makes a critique (analysis) that results
in a necessarily fragmentary narrative, whereas design makes a product
(synthesis) that must strive to be a whole solution to its problem.

The historical narrative is necessarily a fragment because it is limited
by the survival of sources and their provisional interpretation.
Architectural history requires, according to Tafuri, some form of
disciplinary training; nevertheless, it is purely a form of history, not
a form of (making) architecture.

- Concepts and methods
  - 2 kinds of historicism: Avant-garde teleology of history and Crocean
    'philosophy as history';
  - Drops stylistic analysis in favour of 'elective affinities' of
    artists and works with their contemporary context;
  - 'Metodologia dell'elenco' in both historiography and design;
  - Primacy of historical knowledge over normative theory, the latter
    always derived from the former, when it is admitted.
- Domain of architecture
  - Building a structure and building the city as recursive processes;
  - Extant city as main object, infill as main operation.

Italy was a relative latecomer in the universe of formal architectural
education, trailing not only the venerable French schools but also
American universities by several decades [@casciato:2003italian62].
Meanwhile, Italian philosophers from Vico to Croce had been pioneers in
articulating problems of historical consciousness and their application
to aesthetics [@croce:1904estetica]. This precedence of History over the
pedagogical theorizing of Architecture reversed the emergence of a
historical method from within French Beaux-Arts teaching
[@talenti:2000histoire]. The disciplinary framing of Architecture in
post-war Italy therefore gave a role to historical studies and
scholarship at the very core of the debates shaping the teaching and
practice of architects. For the same reason, this disciplinary framing
was negotiated between the two dominant historicist forces of its age:
on the one hand, the Modern movement with its Anglo-Germanic
historiography and, on the other, the native Italian philosophy of
history championed by Benedetto Croce's reading of the eighteenth
century Idealist thinker, Giambattista Vico. Croce had been highly
influential in education reforms enacted in Italy both before and during
the Fascist regime. Croce's emphasis on art and individual expression,
as well as his subsuming of Theory as a subset of History, became
touchstones of twentieth century Italian Idealism.

Bruno Zevi was one of the prominent Idealists in Italy. His early
monograph *Architettura e storiografia*, published in 1950, was,
nevertheless, naïvely derivative of the use of history as a
justification for the avant-garde, and therefore reminiscent of
Pevsner's and Giedion's militant agenda of the preceding decades.
Despite this shortcoming, it already presented three major themes that
were to concern the Italian articulation of the disciplinary scopes of
Architecture and its historiography: first, the relationship between an
individual artist or work and its broader context, both 'horizontally'
among contemporary artists and the social context, and 'vertically',
across the ages; second, the tension between the *doxa* that historic
towns are supposed to express the *Zeitgeist* of some past age and the
awareness that Italian cities are more like unintelligible palimpsests
of continuous occupation and adaptation; and third, perhaps most
importantly, the need to legitimize normative theory by constricting it
to strict methodological bounds, while at the same time explaining all
present and future developments in exclusively historical terms
[@zevi:1974architettura, 12, 55, 128].

Each of these three themes entailed corresponding attitudes towards
Architecture, fueling certain disciplinary debates at least since the
mid 1960s. To begin with, Zevi's brand of teleological Idealism rejected
the Anglo-Germanic reliance on styles and movements as legitimate
expressions of the *Zeitgeist*. Instead, he was concerned with broad
historical movements only insofar as they demonstrated the drive towards
the emancipation of individual consciousness; nowhere was this more
evident than in the exhibition on Michelangelo Zevi curated with a young
Paolo Portoghesi in 1964. In this program bound on liberating the
individual from the 'context' as a deterministic constraint, Zevi
refused to even admit of typology as an descriptive framework for
singular works of architecture [@zevi:1965architettura1].

That said, Zevi's rejection of collective movements as an interpretive
scheme did not keep him from construing his own teleological scheme of
architectural history: he equated formal organicism with aesthetic
autonomy, while casting aside as inconsequential any facts not building
up to modern organic architecture. Zevi would generally not even
acknowledge the existing physical constraints imposed by the urban
fabric as a relevant context for interpreting works of architecture.
This normative inconsistency on Zevi's part was the foil against which
Tafuri and Rossi would develop their own theories of architectural
history. Albeit coming from opposing ideological camps, both leveraged
the concept of 'fragment' as a way of making sense of the palimpsest
that is the Italian built heritage. The issue at stake was the
possibility of (re)composing coherent images---(re)presentations---from
the myriad fragments left behind as historical sources. In his famous
1966 book *The Architecture of the City*, Rossi portrayed the urban
phenomenon as the present state of a continuous, yet heterogeneous,
process of grafting changes onto a fabric that persists across the ages.
Despite the incoherence of this 'creation born out of numerous and
diverse moments of formation', the city can still, at any one moment, be
grasped as 'a unit in its whole', because 'the possibility of reading
the city in continuity lies in its pre-eminent formal and spatial
character' [@rossi:1995architettura, 72; all translations by me unless
noted otherwise].

# Historicist criticism and operative synthesis #

This is where Muratori and Rossi diverge from Tafuri.

Design cannot claim historical legitimacy, according to Tafuri, because
this is construed after the fact by historians, therefore Zevi is wrong
to assert a claim he is on the one true path of historical development.
Tafurian doxa extends this to a theological dogma stating not only that
one may not claim to be the correct outcome of history, but also that
one may not claim to reconstruct historical processes in design. Because
historical knowledge is always provisional, such a design would
inevitably be proven "wrong" in time, and is therefore a futile
exercise.

Rossi and Muratori claim there is something objectively valuable in
history that can and should be reclaimed through memory (Rossi) or
through critique (Muratori), even though they are subject to future
change. This value lies in conceptual or perceptual continuity with the
existing built environment, but which is which? Muratori claims to be
philosophical, but makes things that are tangibly mimetic; Rossi claims
to look at the urban form, but distills it into abstractions in his
early works. Typology is the mental framework supporting this
reconstruction.

Their theories expose Modernism's (Tafuri's?) critical project as a
failure to imbue critique with normative content and to assess the
validity of that content.

- Tools of architectural historiography
  - History vs. memory
- Memory and the critical consciousness
  - On the ability of criticism to leverage the embodied knowledge of
    spontaneous consciousness (vs Moneo).
- Social responsibility vs individual autonomy is a moral problem

# Typology, abstraction, and figuration #

This is where the Muratorians diverge from the later Rossi and the
traditionalists.

Both Rossi and the first generation of Muratorian architects (Caniggia
and Paolo Marzot) use abstraction to signify the reconstruction of
history is partial. For them, 'crisis' of spontaneous typological
process began with the self-consciously exotic vocabulary of eclecticism
in the 1700s. Partake in Modernism's collectivist ethos against the
individualism of bourgeois eclecticism.

Muratori claims to reconstruct objectively the historical process of
urban generation and, furthermore, to make a critical reconstruction of
spontaneous consciousness where it went missing. His disciples' doxa
makes an implicit claim that only the street layout, land subdivision
and general building envelope can legitimately be made in continuity
with the historical process, whereas building construction and therefore
visual cues such as ornament have been irrevocably disrupted by modern
technology and must not bear any resemblance to traditional forms.

Rossi claims to leverage 'memory' as the current state of the awareness
of history in any given context. Because memory is fragmentary, the
design resulting from this operation of memory is itself a fragment. At
first, the incomplete nature of memory is made palpable through formal
abstraction and lack of detailing; later, Rossi incorporates figurative
ornament (classical or postmodern). The abstract identity carried
through memory is primarily supported by figurative elements in
Tagliaventi's work. This results in 'garden city' perimeter blocks or
courtyard compounds favouring visual cues over the abstract
infrastructure of street layout and land subdivision.

- Typology and its conflicts
  - Does 'type' exist?
  - Scales of typology: space, structure, ornament;
  - Typological process is a form of historicism.
- Traditionalism in Process
  - From 'morality' to tangible objects;

# Operativeness in historical perspective #

- Intrahistory and casticism;
- Present reality is at the same time singular (yet apt to be
  contaminated by the artefacts of memory) and a collapsed state of
  all previous history.

- The present as a *result* of the past is an illusion crafted by
  collective memory, because 'the present' is itself an identity
  crafted in the present;
- The present as *different* from the past is an illusion crafted by
  (teleological) historicism, because 'the past' ultimately does not
  exist;
- Both are therefore inadequate justifications for practice because
  they focus on the *movement* from past to present, which is not
  experienced but is a mental construct.

- The present, collapsed state of the city is all we have;
- The role of history is to *pull apart* this collapsed state and
  to make *discrete* images of its moments in time;
- The role of design is to *synthesise* this collapsed state and
  to make *the whole* coherent and imageable at a single point of
  intervention.
