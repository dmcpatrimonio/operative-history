  ## Abstract ##

  The Italian debates of the post-war era regarding the possibility of
  an 'operative' history of architecture revolved around Manfredo
  Tafuri's critique of Saverio Muratori's method of procedural typology
  and his ambiguous stance on Aldo Rossi's later work. They provide the
  theoretical background for a present-day 'Italian school' of
  typo-morphology. This 'school' is split between the modernist
  disciples of Muratori and the younger traditionalists, loosely
  inspired by Rossi. The points of agreement and of disagreement within
  this school point to a continued reevaluation of Tafuri's call for a
  critical and autonomous historiography, although the theoretical
  pitfalls of giving an operative role to historical knowledge are ever
  present.

# Introduction #

The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy
resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary
writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori (1910--73),
Aldo Rossi (1931--97), and Manfredo Tafuri (1935--94). Their often
conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its
relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary
parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments
for much of the international debate around these themes.
The validity of extracting 'operative' knowledge from history for use in
architectural and urban practice is one among many debates in which
these architects engaged. This controversy is
expressed most clearly in their differing attitudes towards typology as
either an art historical device or a theory of the architectural
planning process.

The Italian universe of typological studies is probably best known
from Aldo Rossi's idiosyncratic definition of the concept, in *The
Architecture of the City,* as the study of 'constants' underlying urban
and architectural 'facts' and discernible in them
[@rossi:2006architettura, 33]. Saverio Muratori's contribution, on the
other hand, was restricted to the technical domain of urban morphology
[@cataldi:2013debito, 14]. Tafuri himself towers tall as one of the
most acclaimed architectural historians of the post--1968 era, not the
least for his combative argument in favour of
critical autonomy of architectural history [@tafuri:1988teorie, 268].
Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical
perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one
another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and
practice. Their respective scopes have been increasingly delimited to
reflect their respective methodological and ideological *partis pris.*
This segmentation of theories and scholarship derived from Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent
engagement with one another's theories [As evidenced by
@moschini:2013saverio; @petruccioli:1998exoteric; @lobsinger:2006new59;
@murro:2019storia]; it also obscures the claim put forward by each one
of them to a systematic representation of and agency on the urban
environment.

These claims unfolded throughout their careers and legacies on four
successive levels I shall develop in this paper. At first, Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri all grappled with the fragmented nature of historical
evidence and the conflicting ways by which they sought to explain
architecture as a process. Their various responses to this problem led
to the second level, in which Tafuri's strictly critical stance breaks
away from the operative methods laid out by Muratori and Rossi. In the
third level, Muratori's legacy of an all-encompassing theory of urban
succession, carried on by his disciples, came to be at odds with the
later work of Rossi, increasingly interested in local and visual
references over abstract theories. Finally, in the fourth level I will
look at a few living architects who have carried on the operative
typologies of both Muratori and Rossi.

# Architecture as process, history as fragments #

Let us start out with the scope of
objects and methods pertaining to the architectural discipline, reaching
back to the superimposition of idealist philosophy and socialist
politics that was pervasive in post-war Italian architectural circles
[@leach:2007manfredo, 47]. This disciplinary framing understood
architecture to be not a specific set of objects, real or potential, but
a process of bringing about change in the urban fabric; conversely,
history was not envisaged as a coherent narrative to be 'found', but as
a collection of fragments to make sense of in a piecemeal fashion
[@zevi:1974architettura, 55].

The 'methodology of collecting' fragments in architectural history had
been made explicit by Bruno Zevi as early as 1950
[@zevi:1974architettura]. At that moment, the tension in Italy between
acknowledging the historic built environment as a collection of
fragments and attempting to extract operative judgments from historical
knowledge was particularly pressing because of the destructive urban
redevelopment then being carried out. Muratori and Rossi both started
out trying to square the circle in deriving a general normative theory
from the collection of historical fragments, while Tafuri pored over the
disciplinary insertion of history within architecture.

Muratori's method of 'operative history' was predicated on an Idealist
understanding of the city as a thing in itself. He proposed in 1959 that
the reality of the city as a piecemeal accumulation of interventions
paradoxically proves its nature to be that of a coherent organism.
Thus, even though historical and archaeological evidence will always be
fragmentary, the coherent process of becoming that is the built
environment can be understood through evidence based synthetic judgment
[@muratori:1959studiIX, 111-2]. Aldo Rossi picked up where Muratori's
1959 article left off. In his 1966 book *The Architecture of the City*,
Rossi thus portrayed the urban phenomenon as the present state of a
continuous, yet heterogeneous, process of grafting changes onto a fabric
that persists across the ages. Despite the incoherence of this 'creation
born out of numerous and diverse moments of formation', the city can
still, at any one moment, be grasped as 'a unit in its whole', because
'the possibility of reading the city in continuity lies in its
pre-eminent formal and spatial character' [@rossi:1995architettura, 72].

Muratori's and Rossi's arguments sought to overcome the 'crisis' of
modernity, which is ultimately a disjunction between what society values
and what it makes. This crisis, as posited by Muratori, lay in the
social desire to preserve the coherence of traditional territories in an
age when the 'spontaneous' and incremental practice that gave rise to it
had been lost to the 'self-conscious' and destructive practices of
modern architecture [@muratori:1967civilta, 24]. To this end, the
processes which gave rise to the mature traditional city ought not be
seen merely as products of their (past) ages. Rather, they were
intrinsically legitimate and necessary means of carrying on the
city-building process, *because* the city was by definition the outcome
of such processes---and departing from them would entail building
anything *but* a real city [@moschini:2013saverio, 176].

# Historicist criticism and operative synthesis #

In 1968, Tafuri's first major theoretical work, *Theories and History of
Architecture*, took issue with this operative programme. He warned that
a consistently historical critique of fragmentary sources would
necessarily yield a fragmentary, provisional interpretation rather than
a normative theory [@tafuri:1968teorie]. Against the Idealist
interpretation of the historic city as a reality in itself, Tafuri
assumed the Marxist stance of refusing to acknowledge any enduring
coherence of the city through time. Because fragmentary evidence is the
only knowable reality, Tafuri would go on to argue, all History can ever
hope to achieve is a continuous scattering and reassembling the
fragments in infinite narratives, among which no definite picture of the
whole can ever emerge [@tafuri:1977storico, 17]. Consequently, any
attempt to derive a normative design theory from historical knowledge
was illegitimate and would be proven wrong in time [@tafuri:2002storia,
80]. Following this reasoning through to the extremes, Tafuri would
eventually hold that no normative theory of design can ever be construed
on the basis of urban context or historical knowledge
[@tafuri:1977progetto; later revisited in @tafuri:1980sfera].

* * * *

The tension between the fragmentary nature of the city and its resulting
coherence was, to Rossi, the embodiment of its physical 'memory', made
possible by the law of persistence formulated by the French geographer,
Marcel Poëte. Such persistence is driven, primarily, by embodied memory.
This refers to those 'urban facts' that hold back the continuous process
of urban transformation: monumental architecture at one end, and the
enduring pattern of land subdivision and ownership at the other. When
these factors are not at play, as in greenfield projects, the physical
urban memory must then be replicated by means of reconstructed
classifications present in human memory. Foremost among these
classifications, in Rossi's theory, is the concept of type. Types are
the 'nameable objects' put forward by Léon Krier
[@krier:2009architecture, 29] and definite, recognizable urban spaces as
formulated by Rob Krier [@krier:1991urban, 17].

# Typology, abstraction, and figuration #

Rossi and Muratori claim there is something objectively valuable in
history that can and should be reclaimed through memory (Rossi) or
through critique (Muratori), even though they are subject to future
change. This value lies in conceptual or perceptual continuity with the
existing built environment, but which is which? Muratori claims to be
philosophical, but makes things that are tangibly mimetic; Rossi claims
to look at the urban form, but distills it into abstractions in his
early works. Typology is the mental framework supporting this
reconstruction.

and operative synthesis,
demanding agreement, if limited and provisional, on reconstructed
'memories' of the urban process to be acted upon critically
[@stoppani:2010lhistoire, 220].

The cracks developing from these conflicts become rifts, on a third
level, between the 'modernist' disciples of Muratori
[@caniggia:1984introduzione, 12]---among them Gianfranco Caniggia, Gian
Luigi Maffei, Giancarlo Cataldi, and Giuseppe Strappa---and the
'traditionalists' [@rosponi:2004new] or 'new classicists'
[@papadakis:1990new]---such as Pier Carlo Bontempi, Gabriele
Tagliaventi, and Cristiano Rosponi---loosely inspired by the figurative
character of Rossi's later work. This cleaving of the 'Italian school'
hinges on the decomposition of the urban 'organism', in the work of
living practitioners, according to diverging hierarchies of abstract and
figurative elements [An example of conflicting hierarchies is patent in
the ancillary role ascribed to construction and detailing in
@caniggia:1987progetto]. This conflict exposes conceptual weaknesses in
the theories supporting typological design, in terms of the choices
practitioners make when appropriating and making sense of urban
fragments.

This is where the Muratorians diverge from the later Rossi and the
traditionalists.

Both Rossi and the first generation of Muratorian architects (Caniggia
and Paolo Marzot) use abstraction to signify the reconstruction of
history is partial. For them, 'crisis' of spontaneous typological
process began with the self-consciously exotic vocabulary of eclecticism
in the 1700s. Partake in Modernism's collectivist ethos against the
individualism of bourgeois eclecticism.

Muratori claims to reconstruct objectively the historical process of
urban generation and, furthermore, to make a critical reconstruction of
spontaneous consciousness where it went missing. His disciples' doxa
makes an implicit claim that only the street layout, land subdivision
and general building envelope can legitimately be made in continuity
with the historical process, whereas building construction and therefore
visual cues such as ornament have been irrevocably disrupted by modern
technology and must not bear any resemblance to traditional forms.

Rossi claims to leverage 'memory' as the current state of the awareness
of history in any given context. Because memory is fragmentary, the
design resulting from this operation of memory is itself a fragment. At
first, the incomplete nature of memory is made palpable through formal
abstraction and lack of detailing; later, Rossi incorporates figurative
ornament (classical or postmodern). The abstract identity carried
through memory is primarily supported by figurative elements in
Tagliaventi's work. This results in 'garden city' perimeter blocks or
courtyard compounds favouring visual cues over the abstract
infrastructure of street layout and land subdivision.

# Operativeness in historical perspective #

Thus, the analysis turns back for a final look at how critical
historiography addresses the shortcomings of operativity. By looking at
the interaction of historical scholarship and design practice in the
work of architects who combine both activities [See, for example,
@tagliaventi:2007manuale; @tagliaventi:2000tecniche], the theoretical
assumptions linking both fields become clear. The typological
contradictions between the 'historic city' strictly
defined---preindustrial urbanism [@caniggia:2008lettura, 23]---and the
urban fabric of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
appears as an unresolved conflict  in the methods and judgements of
'modernists' from the Muratorian school [@strappa:1989tradizione] and of
traditionalists alike [@tagliaventi:2006european18].

- Intrahistory and casticism;
- Present reality is at the same time singular (yet apt to be
  contaminated by the artefacts of memory) and a collapsed state of
  all previous history.

- The present as a *result* of the past is an illusion crafted by
  collective memory, because 'the present' is itself an identity
  crafted in the present;
- The present as *different* from the past is an illusion crafted by
  (teleological) historicism, because 'the past' ultimately does not
  exist;
- Both are therefore inadequate justifications for practice because
  they focus on the *movement* from past to present, which is not
  experienced but is a mental construct.

- The present, collapsed state of the city is all we have;
- The role of history is to *pull apart* this collapsed state and
  to make *discrete* images of its moments in time;
- The role of design is to *synthesise* this collapsed state and
  to make *the whole* coherent and imageable at a single point of
  intervention.
