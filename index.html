<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The Italian debates of the post-war era regarding the possibility of an ‘operative’ history of architecture revolved around Manfredo Tafuri’s critique of Saverio Muratori’s method of procedural typology and his ambiguous stance on Aldo Rossi’s later work. They provide the theoretical background for a present-day ‘Italian school’ of typo-morphology. This ‘school’ is split between the modernist disciples of Muratori and the younger traditionalists, loosely inspired by Rossi. The points of agreement and of disagreement within this school point to a continued reevaluation of Tafuri’s call for a critical and autonomous historiography, although the theoretical pitfalls of giving an operative role to historical knowledge are ever present.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori (fig. 1), Aldo Rossi (fig. 2), and Manfredo Tafuri (fig. 3). Their often conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments for much of the international debate around these themes. The validity of extracting ‘operative’ knowledge from history for use in architectural and urban practice is one among many debates in which these architects engaged. This controversy is expressed most clearly in their differing attitudes towards typology as either an art historical device or a theory of the architectural planning process.</p>

<p>The Italian universe of typological studies is probably best known from Aldo Rossi’s idiosyncratic definition of the concept, in <em>The Architecture of the City,</em> as the study of ‘constants’ underlying urban and architectural ‘facts’ and discernible in them.<span class="citation" data-cites="rossi:1995larchitettura"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Aldo Rossi, <em>L’architettura della città</em>, 3rd ed., [1966] (<span>Torino</span>: <span>CittàStudi</span>, 1995), 33.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Saverio Muratori’s contribution, on the other hand, was restricted to the technical domain of urban morphology.<span class="citation" data-cites="cataldi:2013debito"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Giancarlo Cataldi, <span>“Saverio Muratori: il debito e l’eredità,”</span> in <em>Saverio Muratori architetto (Modena 1910-Roma 1973): a cento anni dalla nascita: atti del convegno itinerante</em>, ed.

<br />
</span></span></span> Tafuri himself towers tall as one of the most acclaimed architectural historians of the post–1968 era, not the least for his combative argument in favour of critical autonomy of architectural history.<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1988teorie"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Manfredo Tafuri, <em>Teorie e storia dell’architettura</em>, 7th ed., Biblioteca Universale Laterza 166 (<span>Bari</span>: <span>Laterza</span>, 1988), 268.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and practice. Their respective scopes have been increasingly delimited to reflect their respective methodological and ideological <em>partis pris.</em> This segmentation of theories and scholarship derived from Muratori, Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent engagement with one another’s theories;<span class="citation" data-cites="moschini:2013saverio petruccioli:1998exoteric lobsinger:2006new59 murro:2019storia"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">As evidenced by Francesco Moschini, <span>“Saverio Muratori e Aldo Rossi: le forme dell’architettura e le forme della città,”</span> in <em>Saverio Muratori architetto (Modena 1910-Roma 1973): a cento anni dalla nascita: atti del convegno itinerante</em>, ed.

</span></span></span> it also obscures the claim put forward by each one of them to a systematic representation of and agency on the urban environment.</p>
<p>These claims unfolded throughout their careers and legacies on four successive levels I shall develop in this paper. At first, Muratori, Rossi, and Tafuri all grappled with the fragmented nature of historical evidence and the conflicting ways by which they sought to explain architecture as a process. Their various responses to this problem led to the second level, in which Tafuri’s strictly critical stance breaks away from the operative methods laid out by Muratori and Rossi. In the third level, Muratori’s legacy of an all-encompassing theory of urban succession, carried on by his disciples, came to be at odds with the later work of Rossi, increasingly interested in local and visual references over abstract theories. Finally, in the fourth level I will look at a few living architects who have carried on the operative typologies of both Muratori and Rossi.</p>

<h2>Architecture as process, history as fragments</h2>
<p>Let us start out with the scope of objects and methods pertaining to the architectural discipline, reaching back to the superimposition of Idealist philosophy and socialist politics that was pervasive in post-war Italian architectural circles.<span class="citation" data-cites="leach:2007manfredo"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Andrew Leach, <em>Manfredo <span>Tafuri</span>: Choosing History</em> (<span>Ghent</span>: <span>A&amp;S Books</span>, 2007), 47.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> This disciplinary framing understood architecture to be not a specific set of objects, real or potential, but a process of bringing about change in the urban fabric. Conversely, history was not envisaged as a coherent narrative to be ‘found,’ but as a collection of fragments to make sense of in a piecemeal fashion. The ‘methodology of collecting’ fragments as an analogy for the study of architectural history had been made explicit by Bruno Zevi as early as 1950.<span class="citation" data-cites="zevi:1974architettura"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Bruno Zevi, <em>Architettura e storiografia: le matrici antiche del linguaggio moderno</em>, 2nd ed., Piccola Biblioteca Einaudi 216 (<span>Torino</span>: <span>Einaudi</span>, 1974), 55.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> However, Zevi refused to relate this collection of fragments within any sort of physical context; the only process he would admit of was the emergence of the ‘awareness of making architecture’ itself,<span class="citation" data-cites="zevi:1965architettura1"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Bruno Zevi, <span>“Architettura,”</span> in <em>Enciclopedia universale dell’arte</em>, vol. 1 (<span>Venezia : Roma</span>: <span>Istituto per la collaborazione culturale</span>, 1965), cols. 616–7.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> that is, the rise of creative freedom, following Benedetto Croce’s aesthetic theory.<span class="citation" data-cites="croce:1947concetto"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Benedetto Croce, <em>Il concetto moderno della storia: discorso per l’inaugurazione dell’Instituto Italiano per gli studi storici</em> (<span>Bari</span>: <span>Gius.Laterza &amp; Figli</span>, 1947), 194.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Zevi’s ‘operative critique’ of architecture predicated on ever growing artistic originality failed, however, to respond to the urgent threat to historic centres posed by post-war development (figs. 4, 5).</p>

<p>Throughout the 1950s, Muratori developed another Idealist theory in response to this threat to the historic city (fig. 6). Against Zevi’s concept of ‘operative critique,’ he proposed an ‘operative history’ in which the reality of the city as a piecemeal accumulation of interventions paradoxically proved its nature to be that of a coherent organism. Thus, even though historical and archaeological evidence would always be fragmentary, the coherent process of becoming that is the built environment could be understood through evidence based synthetic judgment.<span class="citation" data-cites="muratori:1959studiIX"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Saverio Muratori, <span>“Studi per una operante storia urbana di Venezia. I,”</span> <em>Palladio</em> IX, no. 3–4 (July 1959): 111–12.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Aldo Rossi later picked up where Muratori’s 1959 article left off. In his 1966 book <em>The Architecture of the City</em>, Rossi thus portrayed the urban phenomenon as the present state of a continuous, yet heterogeneous, process of grafting changes onto a fabric that persists across the ages. Despite the incoherence of this ‘creation born out of numerous and diverse moments of formation,’ the city can still, at any one moment, be grasped as ‘a unit in its whole,’ because ‘the possibility of reading the city in continuity lies in its pre-eminent formal and spatial character.’<span class="citation" data-cites="rossi:1995larchitettura"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Rossi, <em>L’architettura della città</em>, 72.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>Tafuri, a former student of both Muratori’s and Zevi’s, took issue with both of their brands of Idealism in his 1968 book, <em>Theories and History of Architecture</em>. To approach the concept of history as a collection of fragments, he used a Marxist lens predicating a clear-cut separation between the production of the built environment and its historiographic critique.<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1988teorie"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <em>Teorie e storia dell’architettura</em>, 266.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Ostensibly, this was a plea for an architectural history endowed with ‘positive skills’ to counteract vapid theorizing.<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1991introduzione"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Manfredo Tafuri, <span>“Introduzione,”</span> in <em>La piazza, la chiesa, il parco: saggi di storia dell’architettura (XV-XIX secolo)</em>, ed. Manfredo Tafuri, Documenti di architettura 58 (<span>Milano</span>: <span>Electa</span>, 1991), 8.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> In practice, it stemmed from his Marxist belief that the <em>practice</em> of architecture was, by the late twentieth century, well on its way to dissolving in the undifferentiated scope of ‘planning.’<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1980sfera"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Manfredo Tafuri, <em>La Sfera e il labirinto: avanguardie e architettura da Piranesi agli anni ’70</em> (<span>Torino</span>: <span>G. Einaudi</span>, 1980), 25.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Architecture, in Tafuri’s view, became the stuff of history much in the same way Hegel had proclaimed Art belonged to the past.<span class="citation" data-cites="hegel:1986aesthetik1"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, <em>Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik</em>, Auf d.

<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>Muratori’s ‘operative history’ and Tafuri’s ‘critical history’ both looked at the problem of the historical fragment as the starting point for a discussion of the built environment in a process of becoming, but they looked at it from opposite ends. Muratori took the fragments that made up the built environment as instances of <em>a priori</em> types, then sought to explain the overall coherence of the historic city as an outcome of the typological process.<span class="citation" data-cites="muratori:1959studiIX"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Muratori, <span>“Studi per una operante storia urbana di Venezia,”</span> 103.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> To Tafuri, on the other hand, it is the nature of the historical process that was given <em>a priori</em>: the deterministic advance of capitalist technocracy since the early Renaissance.<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1988teorie"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <em>Teorie e storia dell’architettura</em>, 18.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> The historian’s task was then to fit, provisionally, the fragments of architecture’s increasingly dead body onto an ever-changing picture of this advance.<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1977storico"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Manfredo Tafuri, <span>“Il <span>‘progetto’</span> storico,”</span> <em>Casabella</em>, no. 429 (1977): 17.<br />

<section id="historiographic-critique-and-operative-synthesis" class="level2">
<h2>Historiographic critique and operative synthesis</h2>
<p>The difference between Muratori’s and Tafuri’s treatment of the historical process stemmed from their different philosophies of reality. In the Idealist theory developed by Muratori, the historic territory and its reconstructed past had real, if not immediately tangible, existence.<span class="citation" data-cites="muratori:1978metodologia"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Saverio Muratori, <em>Metodologia del sistema realtà-autocoscienza: dalle ultime lezioni : 1972-1973</em> (<span>Roma</span>: <span>Centro studi di storia urbanistica</span>, 1978).<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Tafuri’s dialectic, on the other hand, handled the ‘perpetual critique’ of historical fragments<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1980sfera"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <em>La Sfera e il labirinto</em>, 4.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> as a way of exorcizing, so to speak, the very existence of a tangible reality.</p>
<p>Tafuri wielded a historiographic ‘scalpel’ to ‘pry open the compactness of historical constructs, problematize them, and prevent them from presenting themselves as “truths”.’<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1977storico"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <span>“Il <span>‘progetto’</span> storico,”</span> 17.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Exposing all ideology as contradictory enabled him to produce sophisticated analyses of Renaissance architectural theory.<span class="citation" data-cites="stoppani:2010lhistoire"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Teresa Stoppani, <span>“L’histoire Assassinée: <span>Manfredo Tafuri</span> and the Present,”</span> in <em>The Humanities in Architectural Design: A Contemporary and Historical Perspective</em>, ed.

<br />
</span></span></span> Yet, when the only tool one wields is critique, everything ends up looking like a crisis. Tafuri’s ideal contemporary architect was, therefore, perennially locked into this state of crisis: either a planner not designer, who would ‘accept the transitional (and therefore ambiguous) role played nowadays by a dismembered and multifarious discipline,’<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:1980sfera"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <em>La Sfera e il labirinto</em>, 25.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> or a destroyer of conventional meaning such as the younger Aldo Rossi (figs. 7, 8), who took the existing city ‘as a mere pretext’ and let architecture ‘hang dangerously in the balance: its reality, never denied outright, but mischievously mingled with the unreal.’<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:2002storia"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-22" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Manfredo Tafuri, <em>Storia dell’architettura italiana: 1944-1985</em>, [1982] (<span>Torino</span>: <span>Einaudi</span>, 2002), 170.<br />

<p>In contrast to Tafuri’s argument for a permanent state of crisis,<span class="citation" data-cites="biraghi:2005progetto"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-23" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Marco Biraghi, <em>Progetto di crisi: Manfredo Tafuri e l’architettura contemporanea</em>, Vita delle forme 4 (<span>Milano</span>: <span>Marinotti</span>, 2005).<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Muratori and Rossi sought to overcome the crisis of modernity, which is ultimately a disjunction between what society values and what it makes. This crisis, as described by Muratori, lay in the social desire to preserve the coherence of traditional territories in an age when the ‘spontaneous’ and incremental practice that hand given rise to them (fig. 9) was being lost to the ‘self-conscious’ and destructive practices of modern architecture.<span class="citation" data-cites="muratori:1967civilta"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Saverio Muratori, <em>Civiltà e territorio</em> (<span>Roma</span>: <span>Centro studi di storia urbanistica</span>, 1967), 24, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RtE8AQAAIAAJ" role="doc-biblioref">http://books.google.com/books?id=RtE8AQAAIAAJ</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> To this end, the processes that gave rise to the mature traditional city ought not be seen merely as products of their (past) ages. Rather, they were intrinsically legitimate and necessary means of carrying on the city-building process, <em>because</em> the city was by definition the outcome of such processes (fig. 10)—and departing from them would entail building anything <em>but</em> a real city.<span class="citation" data-cites="moschini:2013saverio"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Moschini, <span>“Saverio Muratori e Aldo Rossi,”</span> 176.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> In turn, Muratori saw the crafting of a historical narrative as analogous to the process of city-building, inasmuch as either is only legitimate when it convincingly presents the structural reality of the historical process.<span class="citation" data-cites="muratori:1959studiIX"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-26" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Muratori, <span>“Studi per una operante storia urbana di Venezia,”</span> 112.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>The tension between the fragmentary nature of the city and its resulting coherence was, to Rossi, the embodiment of its physical ‘memory,’ made possible by Marcel Poëte’s law of persistence in plan. Such persistence is driven, primarily, by embodied memory. This refers to those ‘urban facts’ that hold back the continuous process of urban transformation: monumental architecture at one end, and the enduring pattern of land subdivision and ownership at the other.<span class="citation" data-cites="rossi:1995larchitettura"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Rossi, <em>L’architettura della città</em>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> When these factors are not at play, as in greenfield projects, the physical urban memory must then be replicated by means of reconstructed classifications present in human memory (fig. 11). Both Muratori and Rossi thus claimed identity between the synthetic reconstruction of the process that has brought about the historic city as it exists and a normative theory of how best to build upon this process. For both Muratori and Rossi, the concept of type was central to this unified operation that both describes and directs city-building.</p>

<h2>Typology, abstraction, and figuration</h2>

</figure>
<p>The concept of typology as a descriptive device in architectural history has been asserted by authors with a wide range of theoretical allegiances, from Argan and Moudon to Corona Martínez and Panerai.<span class="citation" data-cites="argan:1966tipologia14 moudon:1994getting corona:2009ensayo panerai:2012analyse"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-28" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Giulio Carlo Argan, <span>“Tipologia,”</span> in <em>Enciclopedia universale dell’arte</em>, vol. 14 (<span>Venezia : Roma</span>: <span>Istituto per la collaborazione culturale</span>, 1966), 1–15; Anne Vernez Moudon, <span>“Getting to Know the Built Landscape: <span>Typomorphology</span>,”</span> in <em>Ordering Space: Types in Architecture and Design</em>, ed. Karen A. Franck and Lynda H. Schneekloth, 1st ed. (<span>New York</span>: <span>Van Nostrand Reinhold</span>, 1994), 289–311; Alfonso Corona Martínez, <em>Ensayo sobre el proyecto</em> (<span>Buenos Aires</span>: <span>Nobuko</span>, 2009); Philippe Panerai, <em>Analyse urbaine</em> (<span>Marseille</span>: <span>Parenthèses</span>, 2012).<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> However, its legitimacy as a mediation between the existing city (or a tradition more generally and abstractly understood) and contemporary design has been much more controversial; Moneo even claimed it would be intellectually impossible for contemporary architects to put themselves in the typological mindset.<span class="citation" data-cites="moneo:1978typology"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Rafael Moneo, <span>“On <span>Typology</span>,”</span> <em>Oppositions</em> 13 (1978): 23–45.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Furthermore, Tafuri’s put-down of Muratori’s method had a point: if typology’s aim was to overcome the crisis of modern development by building upon the process of becoming of the actual city, why was the breakdown of traditions itself not accepted as a legitimate part of this process? Muratori’s outright rejection of this modern breakdown was no different, Tafuri argued, from the modernist rejection of tradition.<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:2002storia"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-30" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <em>Storia dell’architettura italiana</em>, 78.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>To complicate matters further, Muratori’s most prominent disciple, Gianfranco Caniggia (1933–87), subscribed quite explicitly to the modernist denunciation of eclecticism as inauthentic and commended the ‘noble aspirations’ of the Modern movement.<span class="citation" data-cites="caniggia:2008lettura"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-31" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gianfranco Caniggia and Gian Luigi Maffei, <em>Lettura dell’edilizia di base</em>, 2nd ed.

<br />
</span></span></span> Muratori’s synthesis of an integral fabric of reality to be recomposed by contextual design was thus replaced with an analytical attitude that tried to isolate the ‘structural’ components of urban form while throwing out the ‘recycling of forms cherry picked from the past’ (fig. 12).<span class="citation" data-cites="caniggia:1984moderno"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gianfranco Caniggia and Gian Luigi Maffei, eds., <em>Moderno non moderno: il luogo e la continuità</em>, 1st ed. (<span>Venezia</span>: <span>Marsilio</span>, 1984), 77.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> This compromise nevertheless paid off politically, as Caniggia earned Tafuri’s respect<span class="citation" data-cites="tafuri:2002storia"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-33" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Tafuri, <em>Storia dell’architettura italiana</em>, 80.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> and Caniggia’s own disciples have achieved a prestigious standing in today’s scholarly field of urban morphology.<span class="citation" data-cites="cataldi:2002saverio6"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Giancarlo Cataldi, Gian Luigi Maffei, and Paolo Vaccaro, <span>“Saverio <span>Muratori</span> and the <span>Italian</span> School of Planning Typology,”</span> <em>Urban Morphology</em> 6, no. 1 (2002): 3–14.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> Since the last decade of the twentieth century, this ‘Italian school of typology’ has turned into a continuum ranging from strict adherents of Caniggia’s ‘modern’ identity—Gian Luigi Maffei and Nicola Marzot—to scholars studying eclectic planning as a legitimate step in the typological process—Giuseppe Strappa—to ‘soft’ traditionalists—Paolo Maretto and Giancarlo Cataldi.<span class="citation" data-cites="marzot:2002study6 caniggia:1989permanenze maretto:1989verita cataldi:1989introduzione"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Nicola Marzot, <span>“The <span>Study</span> of <span>Urban Form</span> in <span>Italy</span>,”</span> <em>Urban Morphology</em> 6, no. 2 (2002): 59–73; Gianfranco Caniggia, <span>“Permanenze e mutazioni nel tipo edilizio e nei tessuti di Roma (1880–1930),”</span> in <em>Tradizione e innovazione nell’architettura di Roma capitale, 1870–1930</em>, ed.

<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>A rift remained, nevertheless, between this academically minded group and another circle of architects that formed under the influence of Aldo Rossi’s later work. Starting with the 1979 Teatro del Mondo project in the Venice Biennale (fig. 13), Rossi drifted towards a more figurative take on memory. The scandal generated by this project overshadowed Rossi’s consistent stream of exploration into the use of classical details and the more complete reconstruction of a traditionalist idiom in his later works. Though Rossi wrote little from the mid 1970s on, his designs seem to have done away with the notion he previously held, that ‘crisis’ and a fragmented consciousness were the inescapable conditions of modernity. Rossi’s work, even considering his written works, never achieved the all encompassing rules and procedures of the Muratorian school. Rossi claimed to leverage ‘memory’ as the current state of the awareness of history in any given context. Because memory is fragmentary, the design resulting from this operation of memory is itself a fragment. At first, the incomplete nature of memory was made palpable through formal abstraction and lack of detailing; later, Rossi incorporates figurative ornament (classical or postmodern). The abstract identity carried through memory became increasingly supported by figurative elements in Rossi’s later works (fig. 14), setting him firmly apart from the Muratorian school.</p>

</span></span></span>such as Pier Carlo Bontempi and Gabriele Tagliaventi (figs. 15, 16)—to break away from the cautious abstraction of the Muratorian school. This movement also claimed adherence to a form of typology, in this case the ‘nameable objects’ (fig. 18) put forward by Léon Krier<span class="citation" data-cites="krier:2009architecture"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-38" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-38" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Léon Krier, <em>The Architecture of Community</em>, ed.

<br />
</span></span></span> Their work is outwardly more reminiscent of Italian vernacular and classical traditions than the abstract practice of the Muratorian planners, but another crucial difference shows through on closer inspection. These new traditionalists traded Muratori’s integral recomposition of the historic settlement patterns for an uneasy compromise with mainstream real estate development practices as well as with standard planning regulations. This has given them a larger footprint in the actual built environment, but it came at the cost of debasing the underlying process of traditional typologies (fig. 17). This is not an unconscious distortion, either. Tagliaventi, the most scholarly minded among these new traditionalists, has claimed explicit affiliation to the early twentieth century ‘garden city’ movement as a workable compromise between modern planning practices and traditional urban environments<span class="citation" data-cites="tagliaventi:1988alla"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-40" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gabriele Tagliaventi, <em>Alla ricerca della forma urbana</em> (<span>Bologna</span>: <span>Pàtron</span>, 1988).<br />
<br />
</span></span></span> (fig. 19). Moreover, he is wary of Tafuri’s vision of architectural history as entirely detached from the profession of architecture. Tagliaventi’s historical research is characterized by a fiercely disciplinary approach focusing on the ‘tools of the trade’—compositional devices, materials, techniques, and manufacturing. His <em>Tecniche e tecnologie dell’architettura fra eclettismo e storicismo</em> reads less like Tafuri’s books—anthologies permeated by the single purpose of discussing capitalist development since the Renaissance—and more like Rossi’s <em>Architecture of the City</em>: a collection of fragments building up to an underlying ‘typology’ of recurring practices and processes of disciplinary decision-making.<span class="citation" data-cites="tagliaventi:2000tecniche"><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-41" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gabriele Tagliaventi, <em>Tecniche e tecnologie dell’architettura fra eclettismo e storicismo</em>, Saggi e documenti di storia dell’architettura 36 (<span>Firenze</span>: <span>Alinea</span>, 2000).<br />

</figure>
<p>Now, the analysis turns back for a final look at how critical historiography addressed the shortcomings of operativity. By looking at the interaction of historical scholarship and design practice in the work of architects who combine both activities, the theoretical assumptions linking both fields become clear. The typological contradictions between the ‘historic city’ strictly defined—pre-industrial urbanism—and the urban fabric of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appears as an unresolved conflict in the methods and judgements of ‘modernists’ from the Muratorian school and of traditionalists alike (fig. 20). In Tafuri’s overarching critical scheme, laid out as early as 1968, the distinctions in form and scale between the pre-industrial and post-industrial built environments seemed inconsequential: both were part of a continuous process of developing capitalism, which was more crucially leading to the end of architecture as an effective discipline.</p>
<p>It is true that Tafuri’s initial enmity towards the ‘operative history’ developed by Muratori softened in the 1980s, when the scholarly contributions of planning typology became clear. Nevertheless, the separation between these two methods evidences a fundamental rift in scholarship and practice. History, as understood by Tafuri, is bounded by the fragmentary evidence in sources, and consists of continuous rearrangements of these fragments. This rearrangement is guided by an <em>a priori</em> theory of historical process, which in Tafuri’s programme is the critique of capitalist development. Muratorian planning typology, on the other hand, should be called, more properly, a form of archaeology of the built environment. It is concerned with reconstructing the invisible, structural process between the extant fragments, and does so by assuming <em>a priori</em> that these fragments must be instances of types (fig. 21).</p>

<p>Aldo Rossi took typology into a terrain that had a less rigorous method. This enabled him and his followers to develop a variety of experimentations along a spectrum ranging from extremely abstract forms celebrating the fragmentary remnants of the traditional city, to extremely figurative renderings of classical forms exploring ways of completing the fragmentary state of the built environment. This variety has resulted in Rossi’s work and legacy being sometimes discounted as inconsistent, superficial, or conservative. This approach all but vanished from academic debates in the twenty-first century, even as it has gained a growing foothold in the development market.</p>
<p>All three stances, Tafuri’s historical critique, Muratori’s operative history, and Rossi’s free-form typology, made relevant points about the nature of reality in architecture and its history. In a sense, Tafuri’s implicit foundational belief that the past does not <em>exist</em> in reality is true: all we have at hand is the whole of surviving fragments of history collapsed onto the present; ascribing some of these fragments to ‘the present’ or ‘the past’ is an operation of memory and critique, however ingrained certain attributions must be for any sort of discourse to be effective. On the other hand, this collapsed state of all of history onto the present is precisely what grants legitimacy to Muratori’s normative claim that the existing city be the starting point of new construction. The role of history is indeed to pull apart this collapsed state into discrete images of aspects or moments in a virtual reconstruction of time; conversely, the role of design is to synthesize this collapsed state by making a fractured accumulation of instances whole and imageable at a single point of intervention.</p>
